test if the method is right when add an element to the beginning, end, middle of the list.

3.testRemove()
test to the remove the first, middle, and last element of the list.

test if the nextIndext method works correctly

21.	testIteratorPreviousIndex()
test if the previousIndex is right when in a list.

KNOWN PROBLEMS OR ASSUMPTIONS

I print out the head when my get(int index) returns the wrong node and this makes the index probelm and assign head the index 0. This problem took me 11 hours to solve, really a hard time for me. I asked three tutors and posted two posts on Piazza but none of the answers were related to the ralationship between the get(int index) and add(int index, E data). And also, because of this, I found if I increase the nelems to nelems+1, the system will print out one more node.
Hard but really happy time with this long homework. lol.
